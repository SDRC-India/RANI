            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                The Reduction in Anemia through Normative Innovations (RANI) is a BMGF funded research project
                currently under implementation in 130 villages of Athmalik &amp; Kishorenagar blocks of Angul district
                of
                Odisha. RANI is a social norms-based intervention aiming to reduce anemia among women of
                reproductive age (WRA) by promoting the consumption of iron folic acid (IFA) along with nutritious
                food. </p>
            <p>By design, RANI is a cluster randomized control trial led by the George Washington University in
                partnership with IPE Global and DCOR Consulting. RANI collaborates with the Odisha Livelihood
                Mission capitalising on the strength of the SHGs promoted by them in Angul.<br><br> This MIS monitors
                the
                T4 approach which directs the field level intervention activities described as below.</p>
            <!-- <p>The project includes three distinct streams of work:</p>
            <ul class="abt-us">
                <li>
                    1. formative research needed to design the intervention;
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. intervention activities; and
